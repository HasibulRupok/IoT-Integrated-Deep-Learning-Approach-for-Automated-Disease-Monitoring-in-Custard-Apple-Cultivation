## 📄 Overview

Custard apple (*Annona squamosa*) is highly susceptible to multiple fungal and pest-related diseases that significantly reduce yield and crop quality. Early and accurate disease detection is critical for sustainable cultivation.

This project proposes a **hybrid deep learning architecture integrated with an IoT-enabled smart agriculture framework** to automatically detect custard apple diseases from fruit and leaf images. The system combines multiple pretrained CNN models with channel-wise attention and is designed to be deployable in **edge–cloud IoT environments**.
